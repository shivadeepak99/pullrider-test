# 🧪 Testing Repository

> **Note:** This repository is strictly for testing and experimentation purposes.

## 📂 About

This is a temporary space used to test:

- Project structures  
- Git workflows  
- Code snippets & tools  
- Deployment pipelines  
- Anything else that needs trial & error

No production-ready code lives here.  
No magic, no miracles — just raw experiments in progress 🧠
